# The Xray core is pinned as a git submodule (third_party/Xray-core, at a fixed
# commit). On every run it syncs that submodule, builds the Xray core from it, and
# fetches the latest geo files — then compiles build/out/vpn-ui-<arch> with everything
# baked in via go:embed. warpcli.sh is committed project source
# (web/service/warpcli.sh) and embedded directly. The static VPN daemon bundle is
# pinned + slow to build, so it is reused when already present.
#
# Escape hatches for iterative dev:
#   SUBMODULES_LATEST=1  pull the LATEST upstream commit for the submodule
#                        (git --remote, tracks the branch in .gitmodules) and
#                        rebuild the core from it. Use after pushing new Xray-core
#                        commits. The pin is moved in the working tree but NOT
#                        committed — `git add third_party/Xray-core` + commit to
#                        persist the bump for everyone else.
#   SUBMODULES_UPDATE=1  force a sync to the RECORDED pin (not the branch tip)
#   SKIP_SUBMODULES=1  don't touch the submodule (use whatever is checked out)
#   SKIP_CORE=1        reuse the cached Xray core + geo files
