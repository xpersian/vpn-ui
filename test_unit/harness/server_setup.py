"""Server-setup phase: build one inbound per protocol (each with 2 accounts),
add two email-based source-IP routing rules against the built-in outbounds
(A-accounts -> `direct`/freedom, B-accounts -> `blocked`/blackhole), and assert
the panel translated the blackhole rule to a per-client source-IP rule.

Topology (chosen so no port/tag collisions and both client VMs are reused):
  - one inbound per protocol, clientToClient + crossInbound both enabled
  - account A on client-VM-A, account B on client-VM-B
  - client-to-client  = A and B on the SAME protocol inbound
  - cross-inbound     = A on protocol X, B on protocol Y (cross-protocol; the
    nftables gate is IP/inbound-level, so this exercises the same code path)

Tunnel IPs are deterministic (radius.go computeVpnClientIP / vpnrange.go):
  IP = 10.<base>.<inboundId>.<2 + clientIndex>, base: l2tp=0 pptp=1 ovpn-udp=2 ovpn-tcp=3
