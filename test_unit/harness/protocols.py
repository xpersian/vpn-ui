    """Editing an account's modes must take effect on the RUNNING daemon.

    The per-mode phases cannot prove this: they read a mode set fixed at inbound
    creation. Here the modes are edited through the panel's updateClient endpoint,
    the same call the UI's client modal makes.

    Getting this to be able to FAIL takes care. telemt reads modes from two places:
    [access.user_modes] (per account) and [general.modes] (process-wide, the UNION
    over accounts). Both must reload for a toggle to work, but a naive sequence only
    proves the first. As built, account A holds all three modes, so telemt STARTS
    with the union wide open; flipping a mode off and back on then passes even when
    [general.modes] never reloads, because the stale startup value already allows
    everything. The test would be vacuous.

    So the union is first narrowed on BOTH accounts and the core restarted, making
    telemt start with tls genuinely off. Only then does turning tls back on require
    [general.modes] to reload, which is the failure this phase exists to catch.

    Sequence:
      1. A := secure, B := secure  -> union = {secure}
      2. restart core              -> telemt now STARTS with tls off (the setup step
                                      that makes step 5 meaningful, not the test)
      3. probe A tls               -> must be REFUSED (baseline: tls really is off)
      4. A := secure+tls           -> union regains tls; CLIENT-only edit, so the
                                      panel hot-reloads instead of restarting
      5. probe A tls               -> must WORK. Fails if [general.modes] is not
                                      hot-reloaded: the listener keeps refusing a

    """An Ad Tag turns middle-proxy mode on for the whole inbound, and Xray routing off.

    Why the client cannot see any of this: the tag rides the proxy->Telegram leg (a
    RPC_PROXY_REQ field, flagged RPC_FLAG_HAS_AD_TAG). The client->proxy handshake is
    byte-identical with the tag on or off, so the prober can never tell them apart and a
    client-side assertion would be pure theatre. Every check here is server-side.

    What is NOT covered, deliberately: that Telegram actually credits the tag and renders
    the sponsored channel. That needs a real account, and it is Telegram's behavior, not
    the panel's. What IS covered is the whole of the panel's contract:

      adtag-off-routing : baseline. The inbound HAS its Xray socks inbound while untagged.
      adtag-xray-off    : tagging any account drops it -> the operator's routing rules stop
                          applying to EVERY account on the inbound. This is the XOR, the
                          one thing a user can be surprised by, and it was untested.
      adtag-config      : telemt is actually told: use_middle_proxy + a direct upstream +
                          [access.user_ad_tags] carrying the tag.
      adtag-middle-proxy: telemt actually ENTERED that path rather than silently taking
                          its me2dc_fallback back to direct mode (see below).
      adtag-relay       : the proxy STILL relays once on the middle-proxy path, so the
                          routing traded away bought something.
      adtag-restore     : clearing the tag restores the socks inbound (the XOR is a toggle,
                          not a one-way door) and leaves the rig as other phases expect.

    Restart, not hot-reload: use_middle_proxy needs a socket re-bind, which telemt's
    hot-reload path skips with a warning. A client-only edit would leave the running
    daemon on the old path and every assertion below would read the wrong process.

    The trap that makes adtag-middle-proxy necessary: middle-proxy mode must first fetch
    Telegram's proxy-secret (a different secret from the user's), and telemt's
    me2dc_fallback defaults to TRUE, which the panel never overrides. If that fetch
    fails, telemt logs "falling back to direct mode" and relays perfectly well with no
    tag on the wire. A relay-only assertion would go green on exactly the state the
    operator is paying routing for and not getting.

    And there are TWO ways to end up on that silent direct path, which is why the check
    is not just "did it fall back". telemt logs the middle-proxy banner BEFORE its ME
    pool exists, then serves over a direct fallback while the pool builds. If the pool
    never comes up (every ME server refusing the handshake), the banner is still there,
    nothing says "falling back", and no tag is ever sent. That is the failure a NATed
    host hits, and it is the one that reached a real user.
