vpn-ui test unit — parallel incus E2E matrix over server distros.

Usage: sudo ./run.sh [--only d1,d2] [--concurrency N] [--tests t1,t2] [-c config.toml]

Flags:
  --only d1,d2       only run these distros (names from config.toml / DISTROS)
  --concurrency N    run N distros in parallel (overrides config.toml)
  --tests t1,t2      only run these tests (comma-separated; default: all)
  -c, --config FILE  config file (default: test_unit/config.toml)
  -h, --help         show this help and exit

Tests (ids mirror harness/model.py:ALL_PHASES; always run in this fixed order):
  core-init       provision kernel modules + packages + xray core
  server-setup    create inbounds + accounts + source-IP routing rules
  openvpn         connect variants + checks + peer reachability (OpenVPN)
  l2tp            connect variants + checks + peer reachability (L2TP/IPsec)
  pptp            connect variants + checks + peer reachability (PPTP)
  openconnect     connect variants + checks + peer reachability (OpenConnect/ocserv)
  sstp            connect + checks + peer reachability (SSTP/accel-ppp, PPP-over-TLS)
  bulk-ops        bulk client add/sub/enable/disable + TXT/PDF export via API
  backup-restore  DB export + import round-trip
  warp-socks      Cloudflare warp-cli SOCKS install + egress
  random-cfg      --random switch: randomize port + creds + webpath, then restore
  systemd         --systemd switch: install + run the panel as a systemd unit
  uninstall       --uninstall switch: install everything, tear down, assert clean host
  export-js       host-side Node TXT/PDF export test (no VM)

Notes:
  * Substrate phases core-init and server-setup ALWAYS run (plus client-prep);
    --tests only filters the optional phases above.
  * Phases always run in the fixed order shown, regardless of --tests order.
  * "all" (or an empty --tests) selects every test.

Example:
  sudo ./run.sh --only arch --tests openvpn,uninstall
